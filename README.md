# ledger-larp

A userscript to LARP your balance on Ledger Live - made by wish and fusi.

# ⚠️ Bugs

Don't expect the script to be perfect, of course there's gonna be some bugs in it so if you see any then please contact [@wasthattoomuchforyou](https://t.me/wasthattoomuchforyou) or [@loficat](https://t.me/loficat). Send us a video of the bug so we know how to fix it.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps money on the real Ledger Live app.
- Working charts.
- Working transactions.
- Always up-to-date Ledger Live app.

## 🛠 Install

1. Install [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live)
2. Then download 
3. Visit `x.com`
4. Press Shift+S to bring up the GUI, tick the boxes on the things you wanna spoof.
5. Depending on the options you checked, there will be textboxes so you can put your real values and fake values in. 
6. Click Save, then exit and use Shift+U to toggle off and on. Click Re-detect (buggy and can end up detecting the fake values instead, causing it to break) if you wanna detect the real values after changing to the fake ones.

## 📁 Files

- `spoof.js`: the actual userscript, it's open-sourced so you can check it however you like.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **visual-only LARP**. It does not change your actual @handle, display name, followers and blah blah blah.
Also if you resell this you are a broke no name
